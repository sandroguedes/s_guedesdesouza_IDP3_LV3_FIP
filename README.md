# MIDTERM FIP Checkpoint

## Introduction
The project consists in the designing and development of a personal portfolio website built with HTML, modular CSS and JavaScript. To know more about I'm trying to build here, take a look at my: [WEBSITE ROADMAP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p99JtoalMNS0GLVIcETt6pV3v1dQenOZLb30loZ-3BA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Completion Status
By it's very nature, this project will always be a "work in progress", however in it's current form I consider it to be in an "alpha" state, meaning it's still very bare bones and I still expect stuff to break here and there. I intend to keep working hard on it until it reaches a state where it looks more like a sable "1.0".

### Layout
The desktop layout has most of it's block level elements in place, so there shouldn't be much left to do on that front. Mobile version, however, is still in-development and not ready for a commit.

### Assets
Two versions of the logo in SVG format are properly applied to the layout. Still missing a third one to go with the gradient background featured in both the home and project pages.
Every other asset currently displayed is a placeholder that should be replaced before final delivery.

### JavaScript applications
Sticky topnav and template project gallery are working, though the code is still a bit "hacky" in some parts. Still trying to figure out how to properly integrate vue.js.
I also have plans in place to develop an introductory micro interaction for the home page's desktop version, but this one is likely to not happen during this term (maybe by the next one).

### Server-Side (SQL, PHP)
No server-side or data-base code has been written yet.
