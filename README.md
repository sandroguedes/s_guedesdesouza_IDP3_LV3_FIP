# Portfolio Site

## Introduction
The project consists in the designing and development of a personal portfolio website built with HTML, modular CSS and JavaScript. To know more about I'm trying to build here, take a look at my: [WEBSITE ROADMAP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p99JtoalMNS0GLVIcETt6pV3v1dQenOZLb30loZ-3BA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Completion Status
By it's very nature, this project will always be a "work in progress", however in it's current form I consider it to be in an "alpha" state, meaning it's still very bare bones and I still expect stuff to break here and there. I intend to keep working hard on it until it reaches a state where it looks more like a sable "1.0".

### Layout
Front-end for desktop and mobile is mostly done, though I will keep adjusting things here and there when I have the time.

### Assets
Layout assets are in place and behaving as they should for the most part. Still got placeholders in the headers and and galleries though.

### JavaScript applications
Sticky topnav and template project gallery are working, though the code somewhate "hacky" for now. Still trying to figure out how to properly integrate vue.js.
I also have plans in place to develop an introductory micro interaction for the home page's desktop version, but this one is not a priority right now and I'll only tackle it once everything else is done and working as intended.

### Back-end
Currently trying my hand at PHP to get the contact form to actually do what it's supposed to.
