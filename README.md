# MIDTERM FIP Checkpoint

## Introduction
This is a repository for the Final Integrated Project for the third term of the Interactive Media Design program at Fanshawe College.
The project consists in the designing and development of a personal portfolio website built with HTML, modular CSS (SASS/SCSS) and modular JavaScript (AJAX). To know more about I'm trying to build here, take a look at my: [WEBSITE ROADMAP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p99JtoalMNS0GLVIcETt6pV3v1dQenOZLb30loZ-3BA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Completion Status

### Layout
The desktop layout has most of it's block level elements in place, so there shouldn't be much left to do on that front. Mobile version, however, is still in-development and not ready for a commit.

### Assets
Two versions of the logo in SVG format are properly applied to the layout. Still missing a third one to go with the gradient background featured in both the home and project pages.
Every other asset currently displayed is a placeholder that should be replaced before final delivery.

### JavaScript applications
No JS is currently integrated into the site. I have plans for write a gallery app for the project page, as well a few functions specific to the mobile version of the site -like hamburger menus and such. Should time allows for it, I also have plans in place to develop an introductory micro interaction for the home page's desktop version, but this one is likely to not happen during this term (maybe by the next one).

### Server-Side (SQL, PHP)
No server-side or data-base code has been written yet.
