                            I am a professional Graphic Designer with almost a decade of professional experience under my belt. During this time, I have worked for companies of varying sizes and fields, and have tackled freelance projects here and there when it was possible to acommodate them in my schedule.

                            I was part of a team of nine where each member contributed with a slightly different set of extra skills and took on a few smaller projects on the side. My role in this dynamic involved, besides designing some of the books, creating illustrations, adapting older materials to more up-to-date standards, research image banks for future projects, checking if all files were print-ready and cataloging the work of my teammates.
